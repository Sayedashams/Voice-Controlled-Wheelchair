# 🦽 Voice Controlled Wheelchair using Arduino

This major project enables a wheelchair to move using voice commands. It uses a Voice Recognition Module V3.1 by Geetech and Arduino nano to recognize simple commands like forward, backward, left, right, and stop.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Enable hands-free control for physically challenged individuals
- Use voice recognition to control direction

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- Arduino nano
- Voice Recognition Module V3.1
- BTS7960 Motor Drivers (x2)
- 12V Wiper Motors (x2)
- 12V Lead-Acid Batteries (x2)
- Relay module (optional)

## 🎤 Supported Voice Commands
- forward
- backward
- left
- right
- stop

## 📁 Files
- Thecode.ino – Controls the motors based on the command received
- Sampletrain.ino – Trains and configures the voice module with keywords
